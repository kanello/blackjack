_The blackjack project was created for the class MPCS 51042

General blackjack rules:
* each player dealt into the game wants to get as close to 21 as possible
* players are dealt two cards at the beginning. Each can see everyone else's cards
* the dealer has their second card hidden
* following the first two cards dealt, a "player round" commences
* each player gets a "player round" where they decide to draw a card (hit) or stay
* if a player goes above 21, they are bust (they lose)
* the dealer get a "player round" after everyone else

Specific rules for this version
* at the end of everyone's "player round" the "game round" comes to a close and the best hand wins a point (normally, players only need to beat the dealer to "win")
* aces are worth 11 points, always
* a fresh deck is used for every "game round"
